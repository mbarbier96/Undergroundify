# Undergroundify
Application made for people who love underground music and want to recommend songs/artists/albums to the public.

## Home Page

The left side of the landing page consists of all the Tracks/Artists/Albums that other users have recommended which the primary user can like so it gets further recommended for other users. The list is horizontally scrollable.
On the right side the user also has everything they have liked in a vertically scrollable list.
